# LEDspot_EasyEDA

## Presentation

The project is a simple small LEDspot that you can use as a decorative or as a simple light.
His small size and his large amount of LEDs allows it to illuminate a lot (_but take into consideration that it is not sufficient to be used as a proper room light_).

And there is what it look like once I assemble it:

## Idea of use

In this section I want to give you tips in order to use this thing correctly.

First of all I design this board mainly because I've work on a LED controller base on a ESP8266. So the first 'little' project that I've done was with my luciole board (all the documentation [here](https://github.com/Weldybox-en/Luciole-v1.0)).

Then I design in fusion 360 and 3d print an enclosure in order to give it a better look on a table a soil or whatever! You can find my 3d files on the directory _"3D_files"_.

### _##__SOON__##_
This 3d enclosure and the boards are availidable on my tindie on a kit form that you can buy and mount by yourself! _(take a look bellow)_.
